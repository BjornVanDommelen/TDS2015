Loosely adapted from https://bardevblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/setting-up-angularjs-angular-seed-node-js-and-karma/

1. Download angular-seed from github https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
2. Extract to a local folder
3. Install nodejs https://nodejs.org/ use the "install" option. This downloads an MSI. Run it. Install everything.
4. Verify nodejs works
Open up a command prompt and type "node". This should give you a "nodejs shell prompt" which looks like this: >
Type 2+2 and hit enter. The next line should say "4".
Type CTRL+C twice to exit the nodejs shell.
5. Install karma
Use "npm install -g karma"
6. Install karma plugins
Use "npm install -g karma-chrome-launcher"
Use "npm install -g karma-firefox-launcher"
Use "npm install -g karma-jasmine"
Use "npm install -g karma-junit-reporter"
7. Install the angular seed dependencies
Use "npm install" from the directory where your angular seed application was extracted (G:\Code\TDS2015\angular-seed-master in my case).
8. Run the unittests
Use "karma start karma.conf.js"
this should have executed 5 successful unittests

Note that karma stays active; if you modify any of the javascript files in the project it will automatically retest
Quit karma by pressing CTRL+C.

9. Start the webserver and browse the sample site
Use "npm start"; this starts a webserver on port 8000
Browse to http://localhost:8000/app/
