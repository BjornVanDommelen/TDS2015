To solve:

1. Routing. How? Should fully support SEO (so actual urls not just #/something).
   For now lets assume MVC app in the backend that outputs the same HTML for each request (you could hardwire a 404 handler for this as well).
2. Mapping of page to layout? Like what DD4T does with mapping of PT to controller and/or view.
   Should be from page template metadata defaulting to view=PT name or something useful...
3. Mapping of component presentation to layout? Like what DD4T does with mapping of CT to controller and/or view.
   Should be from ct metadata defaulting to view=CT name or something useful...
4. Firing CPs from page? Should be part of the scope? Use a directive?
   Assume a <componentpresentation component="tcm:1-2" template="tcm:1-3-32" /> directive?
5. Linking? How to resolve dynamic component links?
   Linking.svc on odata should support us here but how to rewrite? Filter?
6. Binaries? How to allow download access to binaries?
   Odata webservice can spit out binaries but that gives us "unreadable" urls; maybe fix? Maybe not?
